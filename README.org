* Proman ( Project Manager )

Is a C++ project Manager ( I hope to make it one day )

** Fetures??

Right now it can only make a project name init a git repo

to crate a project:
#+begin_src bash
  ./proman.sh new demo
#+end_src

By executing this command it will generate a folder named demo and inside the folder it will create bin, src, CMakeLists.tx files/folders
inside src folder a simple hellow world program it given.

it will also compile the program immidiatly after create the project
( The "Hellow World" one only )
